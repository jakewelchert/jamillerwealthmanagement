        <h2>Services</h2>
        <p>Though we understand that everyone has a situation that needs specific tailoring to, we believe that giving prudent advice and using cost efficient investments will best serve our clients in the long run. Even though our experience can lend itself in many areas, here are our focuses.</p>

          <h3>Retirement Planning</h3>
          <p>How much do we have to save today to prepare for tomorrow? We can use Monte Carlo simulations, market data, and our third party research to compile a roadmap to retirement. Funding for goals may include vehicles such as non-qualified investment accounts, business retirement plans, and IRAs (Traditional or Roth). By using proper diversification, we can better manage volatility, risk, and expenses to help ensure that the most money is there when needed.</p>

          <h3>Retirement Plan Rollovers</h3>
          <p>Leave it or roll it? We compare costs, investment options, and distribution guidelines when deciding to keep the plan with your former employer or rolling into an LPL IRA. Though IRAs may provide for more investment flexibility, they may not allow for the earlier distributions that your 401k would adhere to.</p>

          <h3>Retirement Income</h3>
          <p>Making dollars stretch as far as possible is paramount after your working years. Minimizing taxes, preserving your principal, and having enough cash for a “rainy day” are all taken into consideration when we look at maximizing your dollar’s post-retirement impact.</p>

          <h3>Preserving Wealth through Insurance</h3>
          <p>This industry has changed more than any the past decade. As many carriers are leaving the life insurance and long term care markets, the product innovations are actually becoming stronger. This is an area where working with an expert can not only make a significant difference on how best to protect assets, but to do so in a cost efficient manner.</p>
